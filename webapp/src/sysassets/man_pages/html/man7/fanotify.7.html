<H2>NAME</H2>

fanotify - monitoring filesystem events
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The fanotify API provides notification and interception of
filesystem events.
Use cases include virus scanning and hierarchical storage management.
Currently, only a limited set of events is supported.
In particular, there is no support for create, delete, and move events.
(See
<B><A HREF="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</A></B>(7)

for details of an API that does notify those events.)
<P>
Additional capabilities compared to the
<B><A HREF="../man7/inotify.7.html">inotify</A></B>(7)

API include the ability to monitor all of the objects
in a mounted filesystem,
the ability to make access permission decisions, and the
possibility to read or modify files before access by other applications.
<P>
The following system calls are used with this API:
<B><A HREF="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/close.2.html">close</A></B>(2).

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>fanotify_init(), fanotify_mark(), and notification groups</H3>

The
<B><A HREF="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init</A></B>(2)

system call creates and initializes an fanotify notification group
and returns a file descriptor referring to it.
<P>

An fanotify notification group is a kernel-internal object that holds
a list of files, directories, and mount points for which events shall be
created.
<P>

For each entry in an fanotify notification group, two bit masks exist: the
<I>mark</I>

mask and the
<I>ignore</I>

mask.
The mark mask defines file activities for which an event shall be created.
The ignore mask defines activities for which no event shall be generated.
Having these two types of masks permits a mount point or directory to be
marked for receiving events, while at the same time ignoring events for
specific objects under that mount point or directory.
<P>

The
<B><A HREF="../man2/fanotify_mark.2.html">fanotify_mark</A></B>(2)

system call adds a file, directory, or mount to a notification group
and specifies which events
shall be reported (or ignored), or removes or modifies such an entry.
<P>

A possible usage of the ignore mask is for a file cache.
Events of interest for a file cache are modification of a file and closing
of the same.
Hence, the cached directory or mount point is to be marked to receive these
events.
After receiving the first event informing that a file has been modified,
the corresponding cache entry will be invalidated.
No further modification events for this file are of interest until the file
is closed.
Hence, the modify event can be added to the ignore mask.
Upon receiving the close event, the modify event can be removed from the
ignore mask and the file cache entry can be updated.
<P>

The entries in the fanotify notification groups refer to files and
directories via their inode number and to mounts via their mount ID.
If files or directories are renamed or moved,
the respective entries survive.
If files or directories are deleted or mounts are unmounted,
the corresponding entries are deleted.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The event queue</H3>

As events occur on the filesystem objects monitored by a notification group,
the fanotify system generates events that are collected in a queue.
These events can then be read (using
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

or similar)
from the fanotify file descriptor
returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init</A></B>(2).

<P>
Two types of events are generated:
<I>notification</I>

events and
<I>permission</I>

events.
Notification events are merely informative
and require no action to be taken by
the receiving application except for closing the file descriptor passed
in the event (see below).
Permission events are requests to the receiving application to decide
whether permission for a file access shall be granted.
For these events, the recipient must write a response which decides whether
access is granted or not.
<P>
An event is removed from the event queue of the fanotify group
when it has been read.
Permission events that have been read are kept in an internal list of the
fanotify group until either a permission decision has been taken by
writing to the fanotify file descriptor or the fanotify file descriptor
is closed.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Reading fanotify events</H3>

Calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

for the file descriptor returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init</A></B>(2)

blocks (if the flag
<B>FAN_NONBLOCK</B>

is not specified in the call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init</A></B>(2))

until either a file event occurs or the call is interrupted by a signal
(see
<B><A HREF="../man7/signal.7.html">signal</A></B>(7)).

<P>
After a successful
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2),

the read buffer contains one or more of the following structures:
<P>

<PRE>
struct fanotify_event_metadata {
    __u32 event_len;
    __u8 vers;
    __u8 reserved;
    __u16 metadata_len;
    __aligned_u64 mask;
    __s32 fd;
    __s32 pid;
};
</PRE>


<P>

For performance reasons, it is recommended to use a large
buffer size (for example, 4096 bytes),
so that multiple events can be retrieved by a single
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2).

<P>
The return value of
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

is the number of bytes placed in the buffer,
or -1 in case of an error (but see BUGS).
<P>
The fields of the
<I>fanotify_event_metadata</I>

structure are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>event_len</I>

<DD>
This is the length of the data for the current event and the offset
to the next event in the buffer.
In the current implementation, the value of
<I>event_len</I>

is always
<B>FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN</B>.

However, the API is designed to allow
variable-length structures to be returned in the future.
<DT><I>vers</I>

<DD>
This field holds a version number for the structure.
It must be compared to
<B>FANOTIFY_METADATA_VERSION</B>

to verify that the structures returned at runtime match
the structures defined at compile time.
In case of a mismatch, the application should abandon trying to use the
fanotify file descriptor.
<DT><I>reserved</I>

<DD>
This field is not used.
<DT><I>metadata_len</I>

<DD>
This is the length of the structure.
The field was introduced to facilitate the implementation of
optional headers per event type.
No such optional headers exist in the current implementation.
<DT><I>mask</I>

<DD>
This is a bit mask describing the event (see below).
<DT><I>fd</I>

<DD>
This is an open file descriptor for the object being accessed, or
<B>FAN_NOFD</B>

if a queue overflow occurred.
The file descriptor can be used to access the contents
of the monitored file or directory.
The reading application is responsible for closing this file descriptor.
<DT><DD>
When calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init</A></B>(2),

the caller may specify (via the
<I>event_f_flags</I>

argument) various file status flags that are to be set
on the open file description that corresponds to this file descriptor.
In addition, the (kernel-internal)
<B>FMODE_NONOTIFY</B>

file status flag is set on the open file description.
This flag suppresses fanotify event generation.
Hence, when the receiver of the fanotify event accesses the notified file or
directory using this file descriptor, no additional events will be created.
<DT><I>pid</I>

<DD>
This is the ID of the process that caused the event.
A program listening to fanotify events can compare this PID
to the PID returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpid.2.html">getpid</A></B>(2),

to determine whether the event is caused by the listener itself,
or is due to a file access by another process.
</DL>
<P>

The bit mask in
<I>mask</I>

indicates which events have occurred for a single filesystem object.
Multiple bits may be set in this mask,
if more than one event occurred for the monitored filesystem object.
In particular,
consecutive events for the same filesystem object and originating from the
same process may be merged into a single event, with the exception that two
permission events are never merged into one queue entry.
<P>

The bits that may appear in
<I>mask</I>

are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>FAN_ACCESS</B>

<DD>
A file or a directory (but see BUGS) was accessed (read).
<DT><B>FAN_OPEN</B>

<DD>
A file or a directory was opened.
<DT><B>FAN_MODIFY</B>

<DD>
A file was modified.
<DT><B>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</B>

<DD>
A file that was opened for writing
(<B>O_WRONLY</B>

or
<B>O_RDWR</B>)

was closed.
<DT><B>FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE</B>

<DD>
A file or directory that was opened read-only
(<B>O_RDONLY</B>)

was closed.
<DT><B>FAN_Q_OVERFLOW</B>

<DD>
The event queue exceeded the limit of 16384 entries.
This limit can be overridden by specifying the
<B>FAN_UNLIMITED_QUEUE</B>

flag when calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>FAN_ACCESS_PERM</B>

<DD>
An application wants to read a file or directory, for example using
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/readdir.2.html">readdir</A></B>(2).

The reader must write a response (as described below)
that determines whether the permission to
access the filesystem object shall be granted.
<DT><B>FAN_OPEN_PERM</B>

<DD>
An application wants to open a file or directory.
The reader must write a response that determines whether the permission to
open the filesystem object shall be granted.
</DL>
<P>

To check for any close event, the following bit mask may be used:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>FAN_CLOSE</B>

<DD>
A file was closed.
This is a synonym for:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAN_CLOSE_WRITE&nbsp;|&nbsp;FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE
</DL>
<P>

The following macros are provided to iterate over a buffer containing
fanotify event metadata returned by a
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

from an fanotify file descriptor:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>FAN_EVENT_OK(meta, len)</B>

<DD>
This macro checks the remaining length
<I>len</I>

of the buffer
<I>meta</I>

against the length of the metadata structure and the
<I>event_len</I>

field of the first metadata structure in the buffer.
<DT><B>FAN_EVENT_NEXT(meta, len)</B>

<DD>
This macro uses the length indicated in the
<I>event_len</I>

field of the metadata structure pointed to by
<I>meta</I>

to calculate the address of the next metadata structure that follows
<I>meta</I>.

<I>len</I>

is the number of bytes of metadata that currently remain in the buffer.
The macro returns a pointer to the next metadata structure that follows
<I>meta</I>,

and reduces
<I>len</I>

by the number of bytes in the the metadata structure that
has been skipped over (i.e., it subtracts
<I>meta-&gt;event_len</I>

from
<I>len</I>).

</DL>
<P>

In addition, there is:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>FAN_EVENT_METADATA_LEN</B>

<DD>
This macro returns the size (in bytes) of the structure
<I>fanotify_event_metadata</I>.

This is the minimum size (and currently the only size) of any event metadata.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Monitoring an fanotify file descriptor for events</H3>

When an fanotify event occurs, the fanotify file descriptor indicates as
readable when passed to
<B><A HREF="../man7/epoll.7.html">epoll</A></B>(7),

<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2),

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/select.2.html">select</A></B>(2).

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Dealing with permission events</H3>

For permission events, the application must
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2)

a structure of the following form to the
fanotify file descriptor:
<P>

<PRE>
struct fanotify_response {
    __s32 fd;
    __u32 response;
};
</PRE>


<P>

The fields of this structure are as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>fd</I>

<DD>
This is the file descriptor from the structure
<I>fanotify_event_metadata</I>.

<DT><I>response</I>

<DD>
This field indicates whether or not the permission is to be granted.
Its value must be either
<B>FAN_ALLOW</B>

to allow the file operation or
<B>FAN_DENY</B>

to deny the file operation.
</DL>
<P>

If access is denied, the requesting application call will receive an
<B>EPERM</B>

error.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Closing the fanotify file descriptor</H3>

<P>

When all file descriptors referring to the fanotify notification group are
closed, the fanotify group is released and its resources
are freed for reuse by the kernel.
Upon
<B><A HREF="../man2/close.2.html">close</A></B>(2),

outstanding permission events will be set to allowed.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo</H3>

The file
<I>/proc/[pid]/fdinfo/[fd]</I>

contains information about fanotify marks for file descriptor
<I>fd</I>

of process
<I>pid</I>.

See the kernel source file
<I>Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt</I>

for details.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

In addition to the usual errors for
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2),

the following errors can occur when reading from the
fanotify file descriptor:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The buffer is too small to hold the event.
<DT><B>EMFILE</B>

<DD>
The per-process limit on the number of open files has been reached.
See the description of
<B>RLIMIT_NOFILE</B>

in
<B><A HREF="../man2/getrlimit.2.html">getrlimit</A></B>(2).

<DT><B>ENFILE</B>

<DD>
The system-wide limit on the number of open files has been reached.
See
<I>/proc/sys/fs/file-max</I>

in
<B><A HREF="../man5/proc.5.html">proc</A></B>(5).

<DT><B>ETXTBSY</B>

<DD>
This error is returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

if
<B>O_RDWR</B>

or
<B>O_WRONLY</B>

was specified in the
<I>event_f_flags</I>

argument when calling
<B><A HREF="../man2/fanotify_init.2.html">fanotify_init</A></B>(2)

and an event occurred for a monitored file that is currently being executed.
</DL>
<P>

In addition to the usual errors for
<B><A HREF="../man2/write.2.html">write</A></B>(2),

the following errors can occur when writing to the fanotify file descriptor:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
Fanotify access permissions are not enabled in the kernel configuration
or the value of
<I>response</I>

in the response structure is not valid.
<DT><B>ENOENT</B>

<DD>
The file descriptor
<I>fd</I>

in the response structure is not valid.
This may occur when a response for the permission event has already been
written.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

The fanotify API was introduced in version 2.6.36 of the Linux kernel and
enabled in version 2.6.37.
Fdinfo support was added in version 3.8.
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

The fanotify API is Linux-specific.
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The fanotify API is available only if the kernel was built with the
<B>CONFIG_FANOTIFY</B>

configuration option enabled.
In addition, fanotify permission handling is available only if the
<B>CONFIG_FANOTIFY_ACCESS_PERMISSIONS</B>

configuration option is enabled.
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Limitations and caveats</H3>

Fanotify reports only events that a user-space program triggers through the
filesystem API.
As a result,
it does not catch remote events that occur on network filesystems.
<P>

The fanotify API does not report file accesses and modifications that
may occur because of
<B><A HREF="../man2/mmap.2.html">mmap</A></B>(2),

<B><A HREF="../man2/msync.2.html">msync</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/munmap.2.html">munmap</A></B>(2).

<P>

Events for directories are created only if the directory itself is opened,
read, and closed.
Adding, removing, or changing children of a marked directory does not create
events for the monitored directory itself.
<P>

Fanotify monitoring of directories is not recursive:
to monitor subdirectories under a directory,
additional marks must be created.
(But note that the fanotify API provides no way of detecting when a
subdirectory has been created under a marked directory,
which makes recursive monitoring difficult.)
Monitoring mounts offers the capability to monitor a whole directory tree.
<P>

The event queue can overflow.
In this case, events are lost.
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

As of Linux 3.15,
the following bugs exist:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>*<DD>

When an event is generated,
no check is made to see whether the user ID of the
receiving process has authorization to read or write the file
before passing a file descriptor for that file.
This poses a security risk, when the
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>

capability is set for programs executed by unprivileged users.
<DT>*<DD>
If a call to
<B><A HREF="../man2/read.2.html">read</A></B>(2)

processes multiple events from the fanotify queue and an error occurs,
the return value will be the total length of the events successfully
copied to the user-space buffer before the error occurred.
The return value will not be -1, and
<I>errno</I>

will not be set.
Thus, the reading application has no way to detect the error.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAQ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2>

The following program demonstrates the usage of the fanotify API.
It marks the mount point passed as a command-line argument
and waits for events of type
<B>FAN_PERM_OPEN</B>

and
<B>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</B>.

When a permission event occurs, a
<B>FAN_ALLOW</B>

response is given.
<P>

The following output was recorded while editing the file
<I>/home/user/temp/notes</I>.

Before the file was opened, a
<B>FAN_OPEN_PERM</B>

event occurred.
After the file was closed, a
<B>FAN_CLOSE_WRITE</B>

event occurred.
Execution of the program ends when the user presses the ENTER key.
<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Example output</H3>
