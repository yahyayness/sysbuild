<H2>NAME</H2>

cpuid - x86 CPUID access device
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

CPUID provides an interface for querying information about the x86 CPU.
<P>
This device is accessed by
<B><A HREF="../man2/lseek.2.html">lseek</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/pread.2.html">pread</A></B>(2)

to the appropriate CPUID level and reading in chunks of 16 bytes.
A larger read size means multiple reads of consecutive levels.
<P>
The lower 32 bits of the file position is used as the incoming
<I>%eax</I>,

and the upper 32 bits of the file position as the incoming
<I>%ecx</I>,

the latter intended for &quot;counting&quot;
<I>eax</I>

levels like
<I>eax=4</I>.

<P>
This driver uses
<I>/dev/cpu/CPUNUM/cpuid</I>,

where
<I>CPUNUM</I>

is the minor number,
and on an SMP box will direct the access to CPU
<I>CPUNUM</I>

as listed in
<I>/proc/cpuinfo</I>.

<P>
This file is protected so that it can be read only by the user
<I>root</I>,

or members of the group
<I>root</I>.

<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The CPUID instruction can be directly executed by a program
using inline assembler.
However this device allows convenient
access to all CPUs without changing process affinity.
<P>
Most of the information in
<I>cpuid</I>

is reported by the kernel in cooked form either in
<I>/proc/cpuinfo</I>

or through subdirectories in
<I>/sys/devices/system/cpu</I>.

Direct CPUID access through this device should only
be used in exceptional cases.
<P>
The
<I>cpuid</I>

driver is not auto-loaded.
On modular kernels you might need to use the following command
to load it explicitly before use:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;<I>modprobe&nbsp;cpuid</I>
<P>
There is no support for CPUID functions that require additional
input registers.
<P>
Very old x86 CPUs don't support CPUID.
