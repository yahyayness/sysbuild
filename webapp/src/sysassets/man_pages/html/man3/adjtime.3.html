adjtime - correct the time to synchronize the system clock
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>#include &lt;<A HREF="file:///usr/include/sys/time.h">sys/time.h</A>&gt;</B>

<B>int adjtime(const struct timeval *</B><I>delta</I><B>, struct timeval *</B><I>olddelta</I><B>);</B>
</PRE>

<P>

Feature Test Macro Requirements for glibc (see
<B><A HREF="../man7/feature_test_macros.7.html">feature_test_macros</A></B>(7)):


<P>
<B>adjtime</B>():

_BSD_SOURCE
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>adjtime</B>()

function gradually adjusts the system clock (as returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/gettimeofday.2.html">gettimeofday</A></B>(2)).

The amount of time by which the clock is to be adjusted is specified
in the structure pointed to by
<I>delta</I>.

This structure has the following form:

<PRE>

struct timeval {
    time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds */
    suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
};
</PRE>


<P>

If the adjustment in
<I>delta</I>

is positive, then the system clock is speeded up by some
small percentage (i.e., by adding a small
amount of time to the clock value in each second) until the adjustment
has been completed.
If the adjustment in
<I>delta</I>

is negative, then the clock is slowed down in a similar fashion.
<P>
If a clock adjustment from an earlier
<B>adjtime</B>()

call is already in progress
at the time of a later
<B>adjtime</B>()

call, and
<I>delta</I>

is not NULL for the later call, then the earlier adjustment is stopped,
but any already completed part of that adjustment is not undone.
<P>
If
<I>olddelta</I>

is not NULL, then the buffer that it points to is used to return
the amount of time remaining from any previous adjustment that
has not yet been completed.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success,
<B>adjtime</B>()

returns 0.
On failure, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
The adjustment in
<I>delta</I>

is outside the permitted range.
<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The caller does not have sufficient privilege to adjust the time.
Under Linux, the
<B>CAP_SYS_TIME</B>

capability is required.

<H2>ATTRIBUTES</H2>

<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Multithreading (see <A HREF="../man7/pthreads.7.html">pthreads</A>(7))</H3>

The
<B>adjtime</B>()

function is thread-safe.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

4.3BSD, System V.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The adjustment that
<B>adjtime</B>()

makes to the clock is carried out in such a manner that the clock
is always monotonically increasing.
Using
<B>adjtime</B>()

to adjust the time prevents the problems that can be caused for certain
applications (e.g.,
<B><A HREF="../man1/make.1.html">make</A></B>(1))

by abrupt positive or negative jumps in the system time.
<P>
<B>adjtime</B>()

is intended to be used to make small adjustments to the system time.
Most systems impose a limit on the adjustment that can be specified in
<I>delta</I>.

In the glibc implementation,
<I>delta</I>

must be less than or equal to (INT_MAX / 1000000 - 2)
and greater than or equal to (INT_MIN / 1000000 + 2)
(respectively 2145 and -2145 seconds on i386).
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

A longstanding bug


meant that if
<I>delta</I>

was specified as NULL,
no valid information about the outstanding clock adjustment was returned in
<I>olddelta</I>.

(In this circumstance,
<B>adjtime</B>()

should return the outstanding clock adjustment, without changing it.)
This bug is fixed

on systems with glibc 2.8 or later and
Linux kernel 2.6.26 or later.
