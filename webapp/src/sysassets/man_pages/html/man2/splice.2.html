<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>splice</B>()

moves data between two file descriptors
without copying between kernel address space and user address space.
It transfers up to
<I>len</I>

bytes of data from the file descriptor
<I>fd_in</I>

to the file descriptor
<I>fd_out</I>,

where one of the descriptors must refer to a pipe.
<P>
If
<I>fd_in</I>

refers to a pipe, then
<I>off_in</I>

must be NULL.
If
<I>fd_in</I>

does not refer to a pipe and
<I>off_in</I>

is NULL, then bytes are read from
<I>fd_in</I>

starting from the current file offset,
and the current file offset is adjusted appropriately.
If
<I>fd_in</I>

does not refer to a pipe and
<I>off_in</I>

is not NULL, then
<I>off_in</I>

must point to a buffer which specifies the starting
offset from which bytes will be read from
<I>fd_in</I>;

in this case, the current file offset of
<I>fd_in</I>

is not changed.
Analogous statements apply for
<I>fd_out</I>

and
<I>off_out</I>.

<P>
The
<I>flags</I>

argument is a bit mask that is composed by ORing together
zero or more of the following values:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>SPLICE_F_MOVE</B>

<DD>
Attempt to move pages instead of copying.
This is only a hint to the kernel:
pages may still be copied if the kernel cannot move the
pages from the pipe, or if
the pipe buffers don't refer to full pages.
The initial implementation of this flag was buggy:
therefore starting in Linux 2.6.21 it is a no-op
(but is still permitted in a
<B>splice</B>()

call);
in the future, a correct implementation may be restored.
<DT><B>SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK</B>

<DD>
Do not block on I/O.
This makes the splice pipe operations nonblocking, but
<B>splice</B>()

may nevertheless block because the file descriptors that
are spliced to/from may block (unless they have the
<B>O_NONBLOCK</B>

flag set).
<DT><B>SPLICE_F_MORE</B>

<DD>
More data will be coming in a subsequent splice.
This is a helpful hint when
the
<I>fd_out</I>

refers to a socket (see also the description of
<B>MSG_MORE</B>

in
<B><A HREF="../man2/send.2.html">send</A></B>(2),

and the description of
<B>TCP_CORK</B>

in
<B><A HREF="../man7/tcp.7.html">tcp</A></B>(7))

<DT><B>SPLICE_F_GIFT</B>

<DD>
Unused for
<B>splice</B>();

see
<B><A HREF="../man2/vmsplice.2.html">vmsplice</A></B>(2).

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

Upon successful completion,
<B>splice</B>()

returns the number of bytes
spliced to or from the pipe.
A return value of 0 means that there was no data to transfer,
and it would not make sense to block, because there are no
writers connected to the write end of the pipe referred to by
<I>fd_in</I>.

<P>
On error,
<B>splice</B>()

returns -1 and
<I>errno</I>

is set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EAGAIN</B>

<DD>
<B>SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK</B>

was specified in
<I>flags</I>,

and the operation would block.
<DT><B>EBADF</B>

<DD>
One or both file descriptors are not valid,
or do not have proper read-write mode.
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
Target filesystem doesn't support splicing;
target file is opened in append mode;


neither of the descriptors refers to a pipe; or
offset given for nonseekable device.
<DT><B>ENOMEM</B>

<DD>
Out of memory.
<DT><B>ESPIPE</B>

<DD>
Either
<I>off_in</I>

or
<I>off_out</I>

was not NULL, but the corresponding file descriptor refers to a pipe.
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

The
<B>splice</B>()

system call first appeared in Linux 2.6.17;
library support was added to glibc in version 2.5.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This system call is Linux-specific.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

The three system calls
<B>splice</B>(),

<B><A HREF="../man2/vmsplice.2.html">vmsplice</A></B>(2),

and
<B><A HREF="../man2/tee.2.html">tee</A></B>(2),

provide user-space programs with full control over an arbitrary
kernel buffer, implemented within the kernel using the same type
of buffer that is used for a pipe.
In overview, these system calls perform the following tasks:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>splice</B>()

<DD>
moves data from the buffer to an arbitrary file descriptor, or vice versa,
or from one buffer to another.
<DT><B><A HREF="../man2/tee.2.html">tee</A></B>(2)

<DD>
&quot;copies&quot; the data from one buffer to another.
<DT><B><A HREF="../man2/vmsplice.2.html">vmsplice</A></B>(2)

<DD>
&quot;copies&quot; data from user space into the buffer.
</DL>
<P>

Though we talk of copying, actual copies are generally avoided.
The kernel does this by implementing a pipe buffer as a set
of reference-counted pointers to pages of kernel memory.
The kernel creates &quot;copies&quot; of pages in a buffer by creating new
pointers (for the output buffer) referring to the pages,
and increasing the reference counts for the pages:
only pointers are copied, not the pages of the buffer.
