ioprio_get, ioprio_set - get/set I/O scheduling class and priority
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<PRE>
<B>int ioprio_get(int </B><I>which</I><B>, int </B><I>who</I><B>);</B>
<B>int ioprio_set(int </B><I>which</I><B>, int </B><I>who</I><B>, int </B><I>ioprio</I><B>);</B>
</PRE>

<P>
<I>Note</I>:

There are no glibc wrappers for these system calls; see NOTES.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>ioprio_get</B>()

and
<B>ioprio_set</B>()

system calls respectively get and set the I/O scheduling class and
priority of one or more threads.
<P>
The
<I>which</I>

and
<I>who</I>

arguments identify the thread(s) on which the system
calls operate.
The
<I>which</I>

argument determines how
<I>who</I>

is interpreted, and has one of the following values:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>IOPRIO_WHO_PROCESS</B>

<DD>
<I>who</I>

is a process ID or thread ID identifying a single process or thread.
If
<I>who</I>

is 0, then operate on the calling thread.
<DT><B>IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP</B>

<DD>
<I>who</I>

is a process group ID identifying all the members of a process group.
If
<I>who</I>

is 0, then operate on the process group of which the caller is a member.
<DT><B>IOPRIO_WHO_USER</B>

<DD>
<I>who</I>

is a user ID identifying all of the processes that
have a matching real UID.


</DL>
<P>

If
<I>which</I>

is specified as
<B>IOPRIO_WHO_PGRP</B>

or
<B>IOPRIO_WHO_USER</B>

when calling
<B>ioprio_get</B>(),

and more than one process matches
<I>who</I>,

then the returned priority will be the highest one found among
all of the matching processes.
One priority is said to be
higher than another one if it belongs to a higher priority
class
(<B>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT</B>

is the highest priority class;
<B>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</B>

is the lowest)
or if it belongs to the same priority class as the other process but
has a higher priority level (a lower priority number means a
higher priority level).
<P>
The
<I>ioprio</I>

argument given to
<B>ioprio_set</B>()

is a bit mask that specifies both the scheduling class and the
priority to be assigned to the target process(es).
The following macros are used for assembling and dissecting
<I>ioprio</I>

values:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>IOPRIO_PRIO_VALUE(</B><I>class</I><B>, </B><I>data</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
Given a scheduling
<I>class</I>

and priority
(<I>data</I>),

this macro combines the two values to produce an
<I>ioprio</I>

value, which is returned as the result of the macro.
<DT><B>IOPRIO_PRIO_CLASS(</B><I>mask</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
Given
<I>mask</I>

(an
<I>ioprio</I>

value), this macro returns its I/O class component, that is,
one of the values
<B>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT</B>,

<B>IOPRIO_CLASS_BE</B>,

or
<B>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</B>.

<DT><B>IOPRIO_PRIO_DATA(</B><I>mask</I><B>)</B>

<DD>
Given
<I>mask</I>

(an
<I>ioprio</I>

value), this macro returns its priority
(<I>data</I>)

component.
</DL>
<P>

See the NOTES section for more
information on scheduling classes and priorities.
<P>
I/O priorities are supported for reads and for synchronous
(<B>O_DIRECT</B>,

<B>O_SYNC</B>)

writes.
I/O priorities are not supported for asynchronous
writes because they are issued outside the context of the program
dirtying the memory, and thus program-specific priorities do not apply.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

On success,
<B>ioprio_get</B>()

returns the
<I>ioprio</I>

value of the process with highest I/O priority of any of the processes
that match the criteria specified in
<I>which</I>

and
<I>who</I>.

On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set to indicate the error.
<P>

On success,
<B>ioprio_set</B>()

returns 0.
On error, -1 is returned, and
<I>errno</I>

is set to indicate the error.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>EINVAL</B>

<DD>
Invalid value for
<I>which</I>

or
<I>ioprio</I>.

Refer to the NOTES section for available scheduler
classes and priority levels for
<I>ioprio</I>.

<DT><B>EPERM</B>

<DD>
The calling process does not have the privilege needed to assign this
<I>ioprio</I>

to the specified process(es).
See the NOTES section for more information on required
privileges for
<B>ioprio_set</B>().

<DT><B>ESRCH</B>

<DD>
No process(es) could be found that matched the specification in
<I>which</I>

and
<I>who</I>.

</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

These system calls have been available on Linux since
kernel 2.6.13.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

These system calls are Linux-specific.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

Glibc does not provide a wrapper for these system calls; call them using
<B><A HREF="../man2/syscall.2.html">syscall</A></B>(2).

<P>
Two or more processes or threads can share an I/O context.
This will be the case when
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2)

was called with the
<B>CLONE_IO</B>

flag.
However, by default, the distinct threads of a process will
<B>not</B>

share the same I/O context.
This means that if you want to change the I/O
priority of all threads in a process, you may need to call
<B>ioprio_set</B>()

on each of the threads.
The thread ID that you would need for this operation
is the one that is returned by
<B><A HREF="../man2/gettid.2.html">gettid</A></B>(2)

or
<B><A HREF="../man2/clone.2.html">clone</A></B>(2).

<P>
These system calls have an effect only when used
in conjunction with an I/O scheduler that supports I/O priorities.
As at kernel 2.6.17 the only such scheduler is the Completely Fair Queuing
(CFQ) I/O scheduler.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Selecting an I/O scheduler</H3>

I/O Schedulers are selected on a per-device basis via the special
file
<I>/sys/block/&lt;device&gt;/queue/scheduler</I>.

<P>
One can view the current I/O scheduler via the
<I>/sys</I>

filesystem.
For example, the following command
displays a list of all schedulers currently loaded in the kernel:
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$<B> cat /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler</B>
noop anticipatory deadline [cfq]
</PRE>

</DL>

<P>
The scheduler surrounded by brackets is the one actually
in use for the device
(<I>hda</I>

in the example).
Setting another scheduler is done by writing the name of the
new scheduler to this file.
For example, the following command will set the
scheduler for the
<I>hda</I>

device to
<I>cfq</I>:

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<PRE>
$<B> su</B>
Password:
#<B> echo cfq &gt; /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler</B>
</PRE>

</DL>

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>The Completely Fair Queuing (CFQ) I/O scheduler</H3>

Since v3 (aka CFQ Time Sliced) CFQ implements
I/O nice levels similar to those
of CPU scheduling.
These nice levels are grouped in three scheduling classes
each one containing one or more priority levels:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT</B> (1)

<DD>
This is the real-time I/O class.
This scheduling class is given
higher priority than any other class:
processes from this class are
given first access to the disk every time.
Thus this I/O class needs to be used with some
care: one I/O real-time process can starve the entire system.
Within the real-time class,
there are 8 levels of class data (priority) that determine exactly
how much time this process needs the disk for on each service.
The highest real-time priority level is 0; the lowest is 7.
In the future this might change to be more directly mappable to
performance, by passing in a desired data rate instead.
<DT><B>IOPRIO_CLASS_BE</B> (2)

<DD>
This is the best-effort scheduling class,
which is the default for any process
that hasn't set a specific I/O priority.
The class data (priority) determines how much
I/O bandwidth the process will get.
Best-effort priority levels are analogous to CPU nice values
(see
<B><A HREF="../man2/getpriority.2.html">getpriority</A></B>(2)).

The priority level determines a priority relative
to other processes in the best-effort scheduling class.
Priority levels range from 0 (highest) to 7 (lowest).
<DT><B>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</B> (3)

<DD>
This is the idle scheduling class.
Processes running at this level only get I/O
time when no-one else needs the disk.
The idle class has no class data.
Attention is required when assigning this priority class to a process,
since it may become starved if higher priority processes are
constantly accessing the disk.
</DL>
<P>

Refer to
<I>Documentation/block/ioprio.txt</I>

for more information on the CFQ I/O Scheduler and an example program.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Required permissions to set I/O priorities</H3>

Permission to change a process's priority is granted or denied based
on two assertions:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>Process ownership</B>

<DD>
An unprivileged process may set only the I/O priority of a process
whose real UID
matches the real or effective UID of the calling process.
A process which has the
<B>CAP_SYS_NICE</B>

capability can change the priority of any process.
<DT><B>What is the desired priority</B>

<DD>
Attempts to set very high priorities
(<B>IOPRIO_CLASS_RT</B>)

require the
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>

capability.
Kernel versions up to 2.6.24 also required
<B>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</B>

to set a very low priority
(<B>IOPRIO_CLASS_IDLE</B>),

but since Linux 2.6.25, this is no longer required.
</DL>
<P>

A call to
<B>ioprio_set</B>()

must follow both rules, or the call will fail with the error
<B>EPERM</B>.
