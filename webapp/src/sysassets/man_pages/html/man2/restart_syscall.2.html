<H2>NAME</H2>

restart_syscall - restart a system call after interruption by a stop signal
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>int restart_syscall(void);</B>

<P>
<I>Note</I>:

There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B>restart_syscall</B>()

system call is used to restart certain system calls
after a process that was stopped by a signal (e.g.,
<B>SIGSTOP</B>

or
<B>SIGTSTP</B>)

is later resumed after receiving a
<B>SIGCONT</B>

signal.
This system call is designed only for internal use by the kernel.
<P>
<B>restart_syscall</B>()

is used for restarting only those system calls that,
when restarted, should adjust their time-related parameters---namely
<B><A HREF="../man2/poll.2.html">poll</A></B>(2)

(since Linux 2.6.24),
<B><A HREF="../man2/nanosleep.2.html">nanosleep</A></B>(2)

(since Linux 2.6),
<B><A HREF="../man2/clock_nanosleep.2.html">clock_nanosleep</A></B>(2)

(since Linux 2.6),
and
<B><A HREF="../man2/futex.2.html">futex</A></B>(2),

when employed with the
<B>FUTEX_WAIT</B>

(since Linux 2.6.22)
and
<B>FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET</B>

(since Linux 2.6.31)
operations.



<B>restart_syscall</B>()

restarts the interrupted system call with a
time argument that is suitably adjusted to account for the
time that has already elapsed (including the time where the process
was stopped by a signal).
Without the
<B>restart_syscall</B>()

mechanism, restarting these system calls would not correctly deduce the
already elapsed time when the process continued execution.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>RETURN VALUE</H2>

The return value of
<B>restart_syscall</B>()

is the return value of whatever system call is being restarted.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ERRORS</H2>

<I>errno</I>

is set as per the errors for whatever system call is being restarted by
<B>restart_syscall</B>().

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>VERSIONS</H2>

The
<B>restart_syscall</B>()

system call is present since Linux 2.6.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>CONFORMING TO</H2>

This system call is Linux-specific.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>NOTES</H2>

There is no glibc wrapper for this system call,
because it is intended for use only by the kernel and
should never be called by applications.
<P>
From user space, the operation of
<B><A HREF="../man2/restart_syscall.2.html">restart_syscall</A></B>(2)

is largely invisible:
to the process that made the system call that is restarted,
it appears as though that system call executed and
returned in the usual fashion.
