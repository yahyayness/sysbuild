00:00.000 --> 00:03.156
<v Lawrence Angrave>Okay welcome to systems programming

00:03.156 --> 00:03.984
<v Lawrence Angrave>so let's get started

00:03.984 --> 00:05.625
<v Lawrence Angrave>let's write our first c program

00:05.625 --> 00:07.906
<v Lawrence Angrave>that makes use of a system call

00:07.906 --> 00:11.359
<v Lawrence Angrave>i'll do an example and then I'll let you play as well

00:11.359 --> 00:13.671
<v Lawrence Angrave>so uh here's a little virtual machine

00:13.671 --> 00:15.609
<v Lawrence Angrave>i've got up and running

00:15.609 --> 00:18.109
<v Lawrence Angrave>and i can write a little c file here

00:18.109 --> 00:22.921
<v Lawrence Angrave>so what we're going to do is make use of a system call called write

00:22.921 --> 00:23.765
<v Lawrence Angrave>so let's try this

00:23.765 --> 00:25.390
<v Lawrence Angrave>we'll say okay write

00:25.390 --> 00:28.750
<v Lawrence Angrave>and then i need to give it a file descriptor

00:28.750 --> 00:30.093
<v Lawrence Angrave>more about that in a moment

00:30.093 --> 00:33.265
<v Lawrence Angrave>a little message like hello

00:33.265 --> 00:37.468
<v Lawrence Angrave>and then the number of characters or bytes that i actually want to send here

00:37.468 --> 00:40.296
<v Lawrence Angrave>so h e l l o

00:40.296 --> 00:44.046
<v Lawrence Angrave>that's five bytes we're going to send

00:44.046 --> 00:47.250
<v Lawrence Angrave>so let's try compiling this

00:47.250 --> 00:50.921
<v Lawrence Angrave>and once that's going we'll see that whoops

00:50.921 --> 00:52.796
<v Lawrence Angrave>we've got a little bit of a problem here

00:52.796 --> 00:56.703
<v Lawrence Angrave>that write was not declared before

00:56.703 --> 01:05.140
<v Lawrence Angrave>okay so the c compiler here is warning us that we're trying to call a function called write which hasn't yet been declared

01:05.140 --> 01:06.875
<v Lawrence Angrave>so we could declare it

01:06.875 --> 01:10.984
<v Lawrence Angrave>now i happen to know for example that the write signature looks a little something like this

01:10.984 --> 01:14.140
<v Lawrence Angrave>it takes um, it's called write 

01:14.140 --> 01:16.687
<v Lawrence Angrave>it takes a file descriptor which is going to be an integer

01:16.687 --> 01:19.578
<v Lawrence Angrave>it takes a pointer to a character

01:19.578 --> 01:23.875
<v Lawrence Angrave>and it takes another integer which is the number of characters to write

01:23.875 --> 01:25.421
<v Lawrence Angrave>so it looks a little bit like that

01:25.421 --> 01:34.828
<v Lawrence Angrave>in fact it takes a void pointer which means point to it without any particular type

01:34.828 --> 01:38.296
<v Lawrence Angrave>so i could attempt to compile this for example

01:38.296 --> 01:40.703
<v Lawrence Angrave>see if this works

01:40.703 --> 01:41.265
<v Lawrence Angrave>and oh ho ho

01:41.265 --> 01:42.546
<v Lawrence Angrave>if we look at the left hand side

01:42.546 --> 01:46.515
<v Lawrence Angrave>we can see we managed to compile a program called program here

01:46.515 --> 01:48.140
<v Lawrence Angrave>and when we ran it we got hello

01:48.140 --> 01:51.921
<v Lawrence Angrave>alright so let's do a little better then that though

01:51.921 --> 01:56.843
<v Lawrence Angrave>rather than me having to manually write the declaration in here

01:56.843 --> 02:01.968
<v Lawrence Angrave>these are already included inside an existing file which I get for free

02:01.968 --> 02:05.578
<v Lawrence Angrave>it's actually unistd.h

02:05.578 --> 02:09.531
<v Lawrence Angrave>okay so let's tell the preprocessor to read in the contents of the file

02:09.531 --> 02:12.359
<v Lawrence Angrave>go in and find a file named unistd.h

02:12.359 --> 02:15.187
<v Lawrence Angrave>and include all the text that is in that file

02:15.187 --> 02:18.234
<v Lawrence Angrave>okay so now when we run this

02:18.234 --> 02:20.875
<v Lawrence Angrave>we'll compile it and run it and great it prints out hello

02:20.875 --> 02:23.937
<v Lawrence Angrave>if i wanted to print out hello with a new line

02:23.937 --> 02:26.375
<v Lawrence Angrave>let's increment this to six

02:26.375 --> 02:29.000
<v Lawrence Angrave>and now i've got a program called Hello

02:29.000 --> 02:40.781
<v Lawrence Angrave>okay great and of course i could make my program print out hello world and do it on two different lines

02:40.781 --> 02:43.484
<v Lawrence Angrave>alright so uh that's my program working

02:43.484 --> 02:45.390
<v Lawrence Angrave>now it's time for you to play

02:45.390 --> 02:49.125
<v Lawrence Angrave>you create which uses a system call write

02:49.125 --> 02:52.578
<v Lawrence Angrave>to write a little message on the two lines

02:52.578 --> 02:56.593
<v Lawrence Angrave>see you in the next video after you've said hello to the world

02:56.593 --> 02:58.703
<v Lawrence Angrave>bye
