# sizeof character arrays, incrementing pointers #
* Can you use `print("%c %d\n", *ptr, *ptr)` to print out the characters and their integer values of the message "A B C 0123" (one character and its integer value per line)?
* Can you write a C program that uses `char*` pointers to print a message in reverse? e.g. "dlroW olleH" should be printed as "Hello World".
