# Hello World (System call style) #
Starting with an empty file, can you write a complete C program to print out your favorite haiku poem, saying or famous CS quote?
Use `write` system call to print your text.
Your main method should return an integer value zero (to mean it completed successfully).
Hint you'll need an `#include` and a `main` function that returns an int.
