# Writing to files - 1 #
Use your favorite search engine to find the man page for `open` (hint: try "man open").
Can you create a program from scratch to create a file `message.txt`, write the short message "hello!" and close the file handle?
Your text file should only be readable by you.
If you run your program again (e.g. `./program` in the terminal window)
Verify the contents of the file using `cat message.txt` in the terminal window.
